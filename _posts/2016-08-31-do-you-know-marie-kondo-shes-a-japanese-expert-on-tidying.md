  Do you know Marie Kondo? She’s a Japanese expert on tidying things up and she
  explains her KonMari-method in her bestselling book ‘The Life-Changing Magic
  of Tidying Up’. To be honest, she’s a bit extreme, obsessed even maybe. For
  example, Marie advices you to thank all your things - one by one - for helping
  you out. Your house, for giving you shelter. Your bag, for carrying your
  stuff. Your clothes for keeping you warm. I don’t know the exact word in
  English, but in Dutch we would call her a ‘zweefteef’. Dutch people, me
  included, are too much down to earth for such ‘spiritual’ advice.

# My new heroine: Marie Kondo
![My socks and underwear the KonMari-way.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cf596a7b-9025-4cc5-87fc-4283f6647262.jpg)

Do you know Marie Kondo? She's a Japanese expert on tidying things up and she explains her KonMari-method in her bestselling book ['The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up'][0]. To be honest, she's a bit extreme, obsessed even maybe. For example, Marie advices you to thank all your things - one by one - for helping you out. Your house, for giving you shelter. Your bag, for carrying your stuff. Your clothes for keeping you warm. I don't know the exact word in English, but in Dutch we would call her a 'zweefteef'. Dutch people, me included, are too much down to earth for such 'spiritual' advice.

But I do like her more practical approach on selecting the things you want to keep (only that what makes you happy) and how to store them. Although Marie explicitely writes to do the happy-selection first, I tried out her folding tips on me socks and boxers. I always just put my boxers unfolded in a box in my drawer and made a 'potatoe' of each pair of socks. She advices to fold most types of clothing in such a way it stands verticaly, so you can see and grab what you need right away. I needed Youtube for some [tutorials][1], but I must admit the result is worth the effort, as you can see. I got so excided, I even tried out folding some pants into vertical packages. I just isn't that hard and I can just feel the benefits of picking my clothes in the morning.

I intend to start the entire KonMari-proces soon, to sort out all my stuff and hopefully get some more spaces. Marie claims each of her clients collects 40-50 trash bags full with things to throw away just by asking yourself: "Does this item make me happy? No? Get rid of it." Once I've started my KonMari-project, I will keep you posted on some more tidying shizzles.
